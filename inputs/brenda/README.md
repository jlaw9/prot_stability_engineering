I was using BRENDA's bulk download file in JSON format, but it is difficult to work with and doesn't have all the info I need
1. If the website groups several entries with a dropdown, those entries comments, proteins, and organisms are all grouped together
2. Doesn't have all the ligand information

I went to the "Classic view" and found that searching for "*" under "pH Optimum" and "pH Range" gave all the data in a nice tabular format
